### About

Welcome to my website! In 2019, I started to grow the desire to use maths, coding and microcontrolers to answer unexpected questions (e.g. Could I calibrate a ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between two object? Does the coffee flow in a pour over machine vary with the elapsed time? Could I automate the classification of objects under a microscope using machine learning?). After some time working as a statistician and programmer in the industry, I slowly strengthened my skills in statistics and programming which allowed me to expand the range of possibilities. Hence, I'm trying this new format to share my original coding and engineering projects on the internet. You can find my LinkedIn and Github linked in the upper right corner.

Happy reading!

### R projects

[**Coffee classification**](coffee_classification.html): Based on coffee beans images, we built a statistical model capable of accurately predicting a bean type. Developed using the packages RVision, Caret and Tidyverse.

[**Skipping rain**](skipping_rain.html): How fast does one need to spin a skipping rope to avoid being soaked by the rain.

**Sudoku**: Work in progress | Computation of the probability of convergence as a function of the number of pre-filled cells in a Sudoku board.

**Covid-19 maps**: Work in progress | Some pleasing visualizations of the pandemic data using geom_tile.

### Interview questions

This section is dedicated to short but interesting interview questions I came across during my studies, exams or job interviews.

[**Pascal's triangle**](triangle.html): Building a Pascal's triangle from scratch in Python.
